**1. Project Overview:**

Develop a coding agent integrated within Cursor to:

- Allow employees to upload PDF documents.
- Extract and index content from these PDFs.
- Enable employees to query the indexed content and receive accurate responses.

**2. Key Components:**

- **PDF Upload Interface:** A user-friendly interface for uploading PDF documents.
- **Document Processing Pipeline:** Extracts text from PDFs and processes it for indexing.
- **Searchable Index:** Stores processed content in a manner that supports efficient querying.
- **Query Interface:** Allows employees to input questions and retrieves relevant information from the indexed content.

**3. Implementation Steps:**

**a. PDF Upload Interface:**

- Develop a secure web interface within Cursor for employees to upload PDF documents.
- Ensure that the interface supports multiple file uploads and provides feedback on upload status.

**b. Document Processing Pipeline:**

- Utilize libraries such as `pdfplumber` or `PyMuPDF` to extract text from PDFs.
- Implement text preprocessing steps, including cleaning and segmentation into meaningful chunks.

**c. Searchable Index:**

- Generate embeddings for text chunks using models like Google's `text-embedding-004`.
- Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to facilitate efficient similarity searches.

**d. Query Interface:**

- Create a user-friendly input field within Cursor for employees to submit their questions.
- Implement a retrieval system that searches the vector database for relevant text chunks based on the query.
- Use Google's Gemini model to generate responses based on the retrieved content.

**4. Security and Privacy Considerations:**

- Implement authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized employees can upload and query documents.
- Ensure that uploaded documents are stored securely and access is logged for auditing purposes.
- Implement data encryption both at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.

**5. Testing and Deployment:**

- Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the system functions as intended.
- Deploy the system within the company's secure infrastructure, ensuring compliance with internal IT policies and standards.

**6. Documentation and Training:**

- Provide comprehensive documentation covering system usage, maintenance procedures, and troubleshooting steps.
- Offer training sessions for employees to familiarize them with the new system and encourage adoption.

**7. Maintenance and Support:**

- Establish a support mechanism for employees to report issues or provide feedback.
- Plan for regular maintenance to update the system, address bugs, and incorporate improvements based on user feedback.

**8. Monitoring and Evaluation:**

- Implement monitoring tools to track system performance, usage patterns, and potential security incidents.
- Regularly evaluate the system's effectiveness in meeting employee needs and make adjustments as necessary.
